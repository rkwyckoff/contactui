ReadMe for Contact front end and backend by Kurt Wyckoff March 15, 2017

1)Built a contact list using angular with ability to add contacts
2)Built states in config file, home state is main screen
Add contact state, show individual contact
3)built templates to display data(name in home state)
and by clicking on name created click event that would display all data about that contact in separate state
4)used ui-router to tie together the controllers and the templates
